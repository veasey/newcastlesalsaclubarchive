		<p>Does such a thing exist? Of course!</p>
<p>Here is my three step plan to shimmy responsibly:</p>
<h3>Situational Awareness</h3>
<p>Are you at a party? If so, this would be a recommended time to shimmy. If you’re not at a party, and are at a funeral or operating<br>
heavy machinery then this would be an inopportune time to shimmy.</p>
<p>Military personnel and assassins trying to retain an element of stealth should<br>
also refrain from unnecessary rhythmic movement of the shoulders. Unless you’re under deep cover at a salsa convention.</p>
<h3>Check Yourself</h3>
<p>Would likely injure yourself or others from spontaneous shoulder movement? If carrying a small child or getting an MRI this would be a bad time to shimmy.</p>
<h3>Eye Contact</h3>
<p>Whilst sweeping the immediate area before a shimmy, be careful not to engage in lingering eye contact with bouncers and members of law enforcement. Mostly because its weird.</p>
<p><em>This is the first part of a field manual I will be slowly compiling on the subject of shimmying responsibly. </em></p>
<p><em>By the year 2030 I will be planning a leather bound hardback edition and a download straight to your brain via your brain chip.</em></p>

		<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t make mistakes, just happy little accidents.” – Bob Ross</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sometimes you expect, or even need someone to do one thing and they end up doing the opposite.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At all levels of social dancing, it’s not uncommon for a lead to be misinterpreted or either dancer to miss a step.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complete disaster? Is the immaculate choreography ruined?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Perhaps not, unless you’ve dropped someone on their head. Did you happen to dance with Stone Cold Steve Austin?</p>
<figure id="attachment_203" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-203" style="width: 340px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-203" src="../../../contents/uploads/2018/04/Steve_Austin.png" alt="Steve Austin" width="340" height="476"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-203" class="wp-caption-text">The Bionic Redneck</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What really matters is how you handle that mistake. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your partner, onlookers and even your humble self will appreciate not making a scene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could even be the making of the routine, despite the perfectly sterile routines in our minds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But isn’t it our minds who control the body? So maybe part of us wants to make that mistake. If the mistake is intentional, is it still a mistake?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Herbie Hancock first played in Miles Davis’ string quartet he played a clanger, a wrong chord [clang!]. Miles paused, then played some improvised notes that made the chord right.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought I had just, like … we had built a house of cards and I just destroyed them all, you know?.. It took me years to realize Miles didn’t judge my chord, I did.” – Herbie Hancock</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dance equivalent to improving a melody to for the chord would be a follower styling out the rest of that bar of music instead of stopping or apologizing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think this is not only an important attitude to have on the dancefloor, but in life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calamity and resolution is a story. Everything going well is also a story, but one where nothing was learned and no room for growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All movement is technically a dance move. Next time you trip just claim you were breakdancing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forgotten everything, standing oddly still? That’s just contemporary! Make sure to snatch at the air a bit and pull it into your chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My backup is always to shimmy responsibly.</span></p>

		<p>It seems that every month I read another bio for a new dance couple that reads something like:</p>
<p>“We first started dancing [dance style] a year ago. We formed a connection instantly and picked up the style in record time. We now teach at [dance venue] every [week day]. To book tickets for [new couple] click here…”</p>
<p>On the one hand, I find these stories aspirational. It’s fantastic that within a year you can meet a fantastic dance partner, venue and paying students!</p>
<p>On the other, I see why people roll their eyes. How could you really learn anything within a year, good enough to teach?</p>
<p>What I really want to learn from these people is not the basics of [dance style] but how they managed to learn both the art of teaching and a new dance style within a year.</p>
<p>It’s the sort of scenario Tim Ferris would write about. He’d learn a dance style, raise the money to build a dance studio and promote it on a radio station he founded in Cuba.</p>
<p>Personally, as a random dude on the Internet, I believe people should be free to do what they want. As long as they’re humble and bringing in something fresh, maybe there is a lot to be learned from them.</p>
<p>I reserve a certain amount of cynicism, however. Teaching is hard. I’ve moonlighted in different disciplines, from time to time, and I’ve always felt it’s like herding cats.</p>
<p>But maybe with enough hard work, and sticking to one aspect of a style. Creating a slick, short class is achievable.</p>
<p>A lot of dancers may comment “well I’ve been dancing [number of years] and I wouldn’t feel comfortable teaching it”. There is a difference, however, of social dancing once a week and practicing every night for [amount of hours].</p>
<p>Maybe an amateur who commits to a goal, and strives for it every day is no longer an amateur? Maybe a professional is only a plastic professional until they’ve gained enough experience?</p>
<p>Either way I’d love to hear opinions from fresh faced greenhorns and old salts alike.</p>
<p>Always remember the following, however. It doesn’t matter whether you’re an excited new dance couple, established Salsa community lynch pin or just scouting for women at socials…</p>
<p>… always shimmy responsibly.</p>

<p>It was my original intent, when creating this website, to show off all the different events that are going on. There’s often an abundance of events, classes and parties but little promotion.</p>

		<blockquote><p>When we encounter another individual truly as a person, not as an object for use, we become fully human – Martin Buber</p></blockquote>
<p>When we refer to the connection between two dancers; leader and follower, it’s a reference to both a physical and mental one.</p>
<p>The physical connection refers to the hold and hand position. Through this, a leader can suggest the rhythm and positioning. He can also signal what moves are coming next and lead the follower through his improvised choreography.</p>
<p>A person might have an incredible command of the English language, say maybe a London barrister.</p>
<p>But would that person be able to form a meaningful connection with a stranger? The same barrister might struggle to hold your interest long enough to progress past painful small talk.</p>
<p>For something so intangible, the connection between two dancers is something that you can see the absence or presence of fairly quickly.</p>
<p>I believe one of the main draws and strengths of partnered dancing is not just the aesthetic beauty, but also the therapeutic quality of connecting with other members of your community.</p>
<p>Some members you may have never encountered or spoke to otherwise, some might not even speak the same language.</p>
<p>Maybe making a more concerted effort to form a deeper connection with other people in our lives would make us not only better dancers, but better people as well.</p>

		<h2>The Sorry</h2>
<p>Racked with guilt, this follower will usually start the dance by standing still looking you dead in the eyeballs before saying “sorry, I’m not very good”.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sorry!</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I often wonder what happened the last time they danced? I suspect it was in some kind of militant salsa boot-camp where they where berated daily by some kind of drill sergeant. </span></p>
<p>Or maybe they are here utterly against their will? Who knows. But what ever it is, they are sorry about it.</p>
<h2>The Dictator</h2>
<p>With the strength and courage gained via one to many cosmos this follower will embark on a one-person <i>coup d’état<b> </b></i>for control of the choreography.</p>
<p>She may proceed to bark commands:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, spin me!<br>
Catch Me!</p></blockquote>
<p>You smile, you ride it out. She says she came with her friend. You recognize her from your last dance.</p>
<p>Her friend shrugs meekly as she mouths:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sorry!</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Poker Player</h2>
<p>You ever danced with someone who looked like…</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-167" src="../../../contents/uploads/2018/03/Pokerface.jpg" alt="" width="285" height="178"></p>
<p>.. this?</p>
<p>I’m talking about this for the whole three minutes. You wonder if she’s bored, offended or maybe a robot sent from the future.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure I haven’t done anything wrong, but I feel sorry anyway.</p>
<h2>The Invisible Partner</h2>
<p>Always hilarious, always available and there to balance any offsets in the man/woman ration during classes.</p>
<p>I solid, dependable dancer who follows every move. She disregards any mistake, sloppy lead and even contorts to overcome any limitations imposed by physics or human anatomy.</p>
<p>She never talks back, and never expects a drink.</p>
<p>Main drawback however, is she’s not much of a talker. Plus she can draw some odd looks at socials. Especially when you try to introduce her.</p>

		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women are already sorted in this department, usually owning enough shoes to stock a storefront.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what about the men? Our shoe collections are usually nice a minimum. Complementing our fridge complete with tumbleweed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stereotyping and misogyny aside – there are a lot of specialized dance shoes on the market, made specifically for guys.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>They Look Awful</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But personally; I think they look awful. They look like the things my parents used to make me wear for school. Not the awesome trainers that lit up (I was a spoiled child). I’m referring to those silly black plimsolls I was made to run miles in or those Clark’s shoes my parents told me where cool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of them have heels as well. If Robert Downey Jr couldn’t pull off Cuban heels, I’ve got no chance.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I’m a little vain when it comes to footwear</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally I visit average trainer outlet for my dance shoes. Not only is because I’m a little vain when it comes to footwear, but when I look at the instructors I more often than not see them wearing a pair of Adidas or Reebok instead of those cabaret shoes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t to say I just pick any. I will admit though, I’ll struggle and adapt to shoes that look cool rather than picking sensible ones (like a woman).</span></p>
<p><b>Avoiding Canvas Shoes</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want them to be </span><b>hard-wearing </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and for this reason I avoid the canvas plimsolls (i.e. those white toed Converse). They just tear during the turns. Maybe it’s my massive bear feet, but these things rarely survive the walk to the party let alone a few socials.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><b></b></p>
<p><b>Boots.</b></p>
<p>These are for Builders and Soldiers. Not Salsa dancers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have legit seen a man in motorcycle boots on a dance floor. It’s ridiculous, a bit of protection against a rogue heel is one thing, but steel toe caps is another. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why I feel the need to advise dancers against wearing </span><b>boots</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Getting Thrifty with Cheap Nasty A** Trainers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite my provocative subtitle I have nothing but praise for these affordable, disposable and generically styled trainers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are incredible light and outlast some of the more expensive .</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they start to discolour or fray you can just buy another pair as well!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cheap soles, which offers no grip during normal situations work incredibly well for turns.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also find these nasty cheap trainers on the internet, and make a fantastic budget alternative to those upselled dance trainers.</span></p>
<p><b>Basket Ball Trainers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last, but certainly not the least. Basket Ball Trainers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These make a lot of sense if you think about the similarities between the surface of a basketball court and dance floor. In a lot of schools and gyms, they are one and the same!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This style of trainer is designed to be hard wearing, and used in a sport that has many sharp and short movements.</span></p>
<p><b>Wear What You Want</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite what targeting advertisers will tell you; I don’t believe any kind of shoe will make you a better dancer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re struggling to perform a move, it’s probably not the floor or your shoes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could be the lager though!</span></p>

		<p>Happy Monday!</p>
<p>To begin a YouTube rabbit hole of Cuban Rumba , this video is as good as any to start.</p>
<p>I find the man’s reaction to having his vacuna blocked by the woman particularly relatable.</p>
<p><iframe width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wi7FFypHLpM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>For the uninitiated, this dance is flirty game where the guy is trying to seduce the woman and he gets attitude despite all his efforts.</p>
<p>But just like life, with enough shoulder movements, deception and begging you can take one home in the end.</p>

		<p>Feeling bored and unchallenged as you find yourself repeating the same sequence over and over.</p>
<p>Maybe you don’t have enough moves in your repertoire or feel like a robot repeating instructions rather than a dancer interpreting the music?</p>
<p>Sometimes its easy to get caught up in the technical aspects and drills, and forget what you originally got into dancing for.</p>
<p><strong>Listen Hard</strong></p>
<p>Really listen to the music. Maybe even sit this track out, and join mid way through when you get the vibe or mood of the piece.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the connection between you and the music is more important than your connection to your partner.</p>
<p>And last on your priorities should be impressing or competing against other dancers. Unless your in a competition, of course!</p>
<p><strong>Be Present<br></strong><br>
As in the moment.</p>
<blockquote><p>When are they going to play bachata?<br>
I can’t remember the routine.<br>
Did I leave the gas on?</p></blockquote>
<p>Just focus on the beat, the vibe, your feet.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling a move, try it. Don’t worry if it doesn’t work, just shimmy it out.</p>
<p><strong>Relax</strong></p>
<p>Remember to breath.</p>
<p>Don’t over think it.</p>
<p><strong>And Mostly</strong></p>
<p>Definitely don’t worry about remembering these steps about not worrying and relaxing. As its totally contradictory.</p>
<p>Its just a blog post, anyway!</p>
<p>Enjoy yourself and shimmy irresponsibly!</p>

		<p>If you want to <strong>move your keister this easter</strong>, then check out the upcoming Salsa Party at Kommunity.</p>
<p>If you’ve got your energy for a full day of classes and workshops they’ll be on through the day, full details on the Hola Cuba event page below.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/334289003728099/">Details for Hola Cuba All Dayer</a></p>
<p>I’m invested as I’m a regular at this venue to begin with. Its also relatively cheap (the event, not me of course).</p>
<p>Most people who will be attending the classes will be aware of it already, but there are probably quite a few social dancers who wouldn’t be aware of my favorite social party.</p>
<p>I’m also invested because its a birthday celebration too. Which means there will be <strong>cake</strong>.</p>
