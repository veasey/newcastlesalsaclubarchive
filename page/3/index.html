		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term “musicality” is often said, but not often understood. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its often used to compliment someone who is hitting all the beats and adapting to the music.</span></p>
<p>It seems to be a subject shrouded in quite a bit of mystery and placed upon a pedestal by a lot of Newcastle salsa social dancers.</p>
<p>Just like timing; not everyone will <em>get it </em>in five minutes. But there are steps anyone can take to up there musicality game.</p>
<h2>Hold Up. What is Musicality?</h2>
<p>Just like timing; not everyone will <em>get it </em>in five minutes. But there are steps anyone can take to up there musicality game.</p>
<p>I believe musicality can be used to describe dancers <strong>comprehension</strong> and <strong>receptiveness</strong> to the music.</p>
<p><strong>Comprehension</strong> of the music played is something that is taught and can be quickly applied. A simple example would be dancing a cha cha step to cha cha music and a bachata step to a bachata rythm.</p>
<p>To further apply comprehension dancers can take into account the mood, and even the lyrics.</p>
<p><strong>Receptiveness </strong>would be referring to how a dancer reacts to changes in the track. How does a dancer react to pauses and fills?</p>
<h2>What social dancers want, but don’t ask for</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think what most dancers want, when they ask to be taught musicality is to have something impressive that they can show of. Something like a well rehearsed, technical shine they can bust out in the Black Swan during a social.</span></p>
<p>This is probably a lot more achievable, and might fill a hole temporarily that you could pave over later more throughly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could rehearse and rehearse an 8 to 16 bar shine to a break in a popular track for a couple of weeks and you might even convince your friends you have that mystic musicality. </span></p>
<p>For those feeling daunted by choreography, y<span style="font-weight: 400;">ou can just take something you learned in a lineup or styling class and string together some moves.</span></p>
<h2>What social dancers can’t be bothered to do, but what your instructor wants you to do</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its an obvious one. Getting your head into the rhythm and song structure will give you a lot more confidence. </span></p>
<p>In particular to the structure of the songs, but also note the fills and drum rolls that signal a change is coming.</p>
<p>The percussion is the best metronome, and saves the mental labor of counting in your head. Plus if your following the song, and know basically what’s coming your not going to get lost if you zone out thinking about lager.</p>
<p>Its possible to be in-time but off-beat. Try to step on a beat, rather than the count in your head. If you’re not sure where the “1” is or where to take your first step, then your going to find it exhausting counting your way through.</p>
<h2>What’s musicality mean to you?</h2>
<p>Its a good question. Its not “get good, quick” and it probably means a lot of different things to different people.</p>
<p>So it might be worth taking a moment, away from Google, and ask yourself what you think musicality is and why you want it.</p>
<p>In the mean time, shimmy responsibly (and with practiced  receptiveness and comprehension of the track).</p>

		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I see and talk to other salsa dancers around Newcastle; the most common trait amongst the more proficient and technical dancers is their commitment to dancing regularly.</span></p>
<p><strong>But isn’t variety the spice of life?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are fantastic events every month where you can do walk out a 1 hour Cuban salsa workshop and straight into a sensual bachata workshop. Have a drink and then do an hour of cross-body.</span></p>
<p>These events are fantastic socials and a great opportunity to dip a toe into other styles. Keeps it fresh, and give you a new direction to pursue if you find something you really like.</p>
<p><b>Forming that foundation</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But being consistently inconsistent won’t build that foundation you can rely on. In any other trade or profession, you need a solid background in one discipline before you can branch off into another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there they can use it as a sort of launch pad, an island in the ocean you can push off from, and if you stray too far you can reach out and steady yourself on that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does consistency foster discipline and measurable progression, but forming a habit of practicing a skill (any skill) little and often will take you much further than if you binge every one to two weeks.</span></p>
<p><strong>Something relatable</strong></p>
<p>I very good analogy would be to think of a boozy night out.</p>
<p>Now if you drink a glass of wine every night, you’ll be fine.</p>
<p>But if you don’t drink for two weeks, then go crazy mixing and binging drinks then you’re going to have a headache the next day and not remember much.</p>
<p>Same applies to the Newcastle Salsa scene.</p>

<p>After not comprehending the Salsa Rhythm at all during my Newcastle Salsa classes (no matter how many times it was explained) this really helped me get my head into it.</p>

		<p>The most common complaint I here in the Newcastle salsa scene is this one.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m not very good.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its not the venues, the prices or the DJ. Its often a growing dissatisfaction with our own abilities.</p>
<p>Maybe the learning curve seems long and impossible. Especially in an age where you can access any salsa track in seconds and order a new pair of shoes with “next day delivery”.</p>
<p>But you can’t download timing, confidence or choreography. Unlike in the following deleted clip from The Matrix.</p>
<figure id="attachment_136" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-136" src="../../../contents/uploads/2018/03/The-Matrix-I-Know-Kung-Fu-2-730x480.png" alt="" width="730" height="480"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-136" class="wp-caption-text">“I know Salsa”</figcaption></figure><h2>Cut yourself some slack</h2>
<blockquote><p>Life is a journey, not a destination<br><cite>– Ralph Waldo Emerson</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>If Salsa was about getting to the end as fast as possible, then we wouldn’t need a full song.</p>
<p>The band could just play crescendos. You would get up, position yourself where you want to end and then walk off the dance floor – high-fiving your partner because you’ve just accomplished all that could be accomplished in this alternative Salsa world.</p>
<p>In this reality, however, a dance will take as long as the song plays. You don’t look at your watch as the song starts and think “Have I got time for this, one?”.</p>
<p>So why is it that we approach learning the steps with that mentality filled with deadlines and milestones?</p>
<p>When your 8 you think being 28 is going to be amazing because you can drive and wear a tie. But you didn’t beat yourself up about not having a driving license as even as 8 you were smart enough to realize that you where at different points in your life.</p>
<p>Unless you where a thick kid. Probably eating dirt and glue for the amusement of your peers.</p>
<h2>What Can You Do Now, That You Wanted to do last year?</h2>
<p>When you first saw salsa you probably thought it would be cool just to have the confidence to get up, take a partner and know a few basics to get by.</p>
<p>Now you’re self flagellating (hopefully not literally, or you might be asked to leave depending on which club you’re in) because you can’t nail a triple spin or incorporate a backflip into your shines.</p>
<p>If previous you could see you now (without tearing the space-time-continuum apart)… or anyone a few months or more behind you… would they want to do what you can do?</p>
<figure id="attachment_137" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-137" src="../../../contents/uploads/2018/03/Doc-Brown.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="287"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137" class="wp-caption-text">Great Scott!</figcaption></figure><h2>Be Grateful</h2>
<p>I bet you know more than you think you know. And even if you still don’t have every turn and step down. Consider the friends you’ve made and the experiences you’ve had.</p>
<p>It’s not the olympics. You’re not being scored. At the end of the day if you had fun, and didn’t break anyone’s toes then you can count that as a bonafide success.</p>
<h2>But I’m Still Super Competitive and what to crush my salsa nemesis</h2>
<p>You’re still reading, but maybe you’ve made a sub-audible tut at this wishy washy feel-good nonsense. In that case, this point is for you. If you where enjoying the wash of feel good nonsense, you can click away and check Facebook now.</p>
<p>When Sir Roger Bannister ran the 4 minute mile, his goal was to run a 4 minute mile. Not to run as fast as he can, or to be the fastest man forever. He focuses solely on that 4 minute mile.</p>
<p>If reaching a goal is tied to your self-worth an happiness, then maybe its worth clearly defining what ‘<strong>it</strong>‘<strong> </strong>is.</p>
<p>This thing you’re trying to get, or achieve that would make you happy; Write it down and focus on that, but just that.</p>
<p>It could be hitting every break on your favorite track. It could be mastering a triple spin. Maybe it’s incorporating a backflip in a shine (I really want to see this now).</p>
<p>So go out there and crush your goals, and leave your nemesis alone. He’s a nice guy really, once you get to know him. We go bowling all the time, honestly he’s chill.</p>

		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “Beast From The East” had turned my street into a ski resort. It was so bad the shops ran out of bread, and then the news ran multiple stories about the bread shortages. I still however thumbed Facebook and sent a message:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is Salsa still on?”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew what the answer would be. But my fear of being left out overrode my fears of getting snowed in on a metro on my to a Newcastle salsa class. Spending the night defending my bread from hungry northerners.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This hasn’t been the first party I wasn’t able to attend due to not being invited. So I was ready with a backup plan of having my own party. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">An actual alternative party this time. Not eating crisps in bed and then telling my mates I had a much better party the next day.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m blessed enough to have a (mostly willing) follower within the house so there was no need to bother the neighbors – not that I am on the best terms with them *.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<p><em>* The neighbors that is.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beaming YouTube to the TV and getting over the weirdness of living-room Rumba (which isn’t a metaphor like the no-pants dance) after a few minutes we might as well have been in the club.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A smaller, tastefully decorated club that lacked such staples as people to trample on my new trainers or that guy who just likes to stare.<br></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also a great exercise in adapting to the uncertainties of life. I say this and I hate breaking routine. It’s not just about sticking to goals but also an opportunity to connect with those close to you.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve got no-one that close to connect to, than there’s probably even more reason for you to put some time aside to nurture a lighter and carefree attitude. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or you could depress yourself by brooding over Facebook or start getting animals and dressing them up in human clothes.</span></p>

And Clint said, “Let there be a Salsa Blog”, and there was a Salsa Blog.</p></blockquote>
<p>I started writing the Newcastle Salsa Club since last May. In my first week I got 7 hits, checking my stats now I’ve got over 3000!</p>
<p>I’m grateful to have shared my enthusiasm with so many people … or disappointed a lot of home cooks looking for sauce recipes!</p>
<p>Originally when I started this my intent was create a sort of Salsa bus stop, where one could see which buses where running and find the next one to jump on board.</p>
<p><b>A new direction</b></p>
<p>Stretching this bus metaphor to its torturous limit, however, its not been the destinations or the drivers that have proven to be the most interesting but the fellow passengers and where they are trying to get to.</p>
<p>Its these stories that I want to dig away at more.</p>
<p>I also want to refresh the site, and offer such outrageous functionality as a better searching and even email subscriptions!</p>
<p><b>But why the effort?</b></p>
<p>Becoming something of a Salsa evangelist, I’ve seen people lose weight, grow in confidence and made some great friends (one of which now lives with me and won’t leave).</p>
<p>I really want to push forward and rather than writing about the Salsa scene for people who are already familiar with it, but maybe reach new people and areas who could find enjoyment in as I have, if they only knew what a great thing we have going in our local area!</p>
<p><b>What do you think?</b></p>
<p>I’m always open for new ideas, and interested to know what people come here for (beside my hilarious wit and fantastic use of stock photography).</p>
<p>If you’ve come here looking for a recipe, then I’ll save you a click, here’s one I found on-line:</p>
<p><b>Clint’s (Found) Sassy Salsa Sauce</b><br><i><br></i><br><i>* altered slightly so I don’t get sued.</i></p>
<p>Ingredients: some tomatoes,  some cilantro,<br>
an onion, garlic, jalapeno, cumin, salt, sugar and lime juice.</p>
<p>Method: blend it all the ingredients, stick it in the fridge. </p>
<p>Serving: Add vodka to taste.</p>

I came to this country in 1975.
<p>When I came here I was going to be an instructor, not a dancing instructor, but an instructor in a University. That was my goal.</p>
<p>I went to lecture in Lancaster University, Manchester University. I met my first girlfriend, and she wanted me to dance salsa. She had seen people dancing salsa. I did not want to dance salsa, as I had only done ballroom dancing.</p>
<p></p>
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LD98j1rWsBk/WnNyyKjxoSI/AAAAAAAAFhU/agNxClEYpTs5zn0faiG-6_j2aNuRCDqsgCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180105_203448442.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="../../../contents/uploads/2018/02/IMG_20180105_203448442.jpg" width="320"></a></td>
</tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Uncle Phil at Newcastle Salsa Congress </td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>
At the time that she met me, I was a professional author. I had my<br>
own shop and did very well, playing golf. And as the business was going<br>
down, and I was taking her out. I decided to take her to Salsa, and<br>
that’s when I saw the dancing.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>
Dirty Dancing was just coming out at the time, and I thought this could be really good. </p></blockquote>
<p>
It could be really romantic for us. So I started attending classes. But within 2 years, because I already had skills in dancing, people where demanding that I should teach them.</p>
<p>I was the best in the classes. That motivated me. So I started teaching in 1994. Up to 95′, 96′ and my class was up to 70 – 80 people per night. I decided to quit for Salsa. I was a social worker then, so I decided to quit. My business at the golf club was also not doing good and I was getting into debt.</p>
<p>So I thought I’d just do some Salsa. I was also buying properties, buying houses and stuff. Then the business just peaked out. I was the only one from here to Scotland, apart from my teacher. My teacher was a policeman. He was old and didn’t want to travel, he didn’t want to be known as the Salsa teacher because of his job.</p>
<p>So I started to go around. Up to Scotland, to do the promotion for Salsa. </p>
<p>In the North of England, including Cumbria, about 75% of people have been taught by myself- people gone through Salsa North West.</p>
<p>From that – and because of the demand – I started to go for competitions and going through competition stages. I had partners here and there, but they where letting me down. They wanted me to pay for their boyfriend’s travel to the competitions and there came a time when I thought about my sister’s kids. </p>
<p>The little girls. I’d coach them. Even if I travel with them, spending the money I am actually developing my own girls. That’s how I started the three girls, and because they where my nieces:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>
They used to call me “Uncle Uncle Uncle!” and people started making it a joke.</p></blockquote>
<p>We’d been doing shows, we had been competing all over the world. </p>
<p>We’ve been to Miami and the British championship. We won the European competition which was to do Salsa. We won the world salsa event in 2008 in Austria. Then after I retired because the British dance council did not want me to continue, and then they made me a judge. As dance judicature, you cannot be a competitor because you know the tricks.</p>
<p>I start to become an instructor for other instructors, and it became a business. I have qualified a lot of people, I train them and they go for exams. Because of these two things, I started hosting the championship itself.</p>
<p>I started hosting the British championship. You cannot organize an official British championship without my authority, you see, as I have the license. I started hosting the competition in Preston and then we decided to go to Bolton. Which is a massive competition, all competitors coming for miles. But it was getting too clustered for me then I lost the sponsorship.</p>
<p>So I started to organize the congresses. Because I had been doing that, all my students all my friends they come up and do all sorts of things. But they do that, I have not stopped to assist them as I am here to assist Sam because we need so many people to dance, and also make a business.</p>
<p>So you see that’s why people respect me, because I’m here to assist on those grounds.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>
As you grow older, you’re not there to lead. You have to leave. They can take the skills that you are offering.</p></blockquote>
<p> I’m trying to pass on to the people and encourage them. This is really fantastic.</p>
<p>To dance. Everybody has got a dance in them, I would encourage that. There is a lot of benefits to dancing, not just the physical benefit of it or the mental benefit of it. You getting on with people, meeting people its so fun. But you have to be careful, its an addiction.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>
You can get addicted.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can tell you. Some of the people that I’ve seen, and that has arrived. I was in Cyprus just a few months ago, and they where there. I was in Bristol, they where there. In Birmingham, they where there. Now they are here!</p>
<p>People save weeks and weeks just to come out, and it becomes part of there life.</p>
<p>I would encourage anybody to go dancing.</p>
<p>
The exercise you do, you don’t even realize that you are actually doing it but still enjoying it. That’s good if you want to live long. </p>

There’s no dance without connection, and there’s no connection without passion. But how do you take your social dancing to the next level?<i> </i>
<p>These are some more highlighted excerpts from my interview with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sol.hissirou" target="_blank">Sol </a>& <a href="https://www.facebook.com/laura.fogliata.5" target="_blank">Laura </a>from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/northernsalsa/" target="_blank">Newcastle Salsa Congress</a> which are thought where worth sharing. Even though they talk about Bachata, mostly, I believe the wisdom can be transferred not only to other styles of partnered dance but life in general!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>Never Stop Learning</b></h3>
<p>Sol: Bachata for us is limitless, as its our passion, its our specialism. Even as teachers, we still take workshops. We still take classes. We’re still learning and trying to better ourselves. I think that has a lot to do with the little bit of success we’ve had in the last five years. I think that’s because we’ve never stopped and thought “we’re teachers, we don’t need to take classes”</p>
<p>Laura: Never stop learning!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>Anybody Can Teach You Something</b></h3>
<p>Sol: I believe that anybody can teach me something. In life, or in dancing. Anybody who is anybody can teach me something. Even if its little, its that little thing that adds to the whole that I already have and makes me the person I want to be in the future.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>Its all about connections</b></h3>
<p>Sol: There’s a few Salsa songs I love, but Bachata makes me feel like…</p>
<p>Laura: Connected</p>
<p>Sol: Yes, Connected with the music and connected with the partner. And that could be anybody. Sometimes you can dance with somebody you have a strong connection with, and sometimes its someone I don’t have that strong connection with – but its still enjoyable and that is what I look for when I dance with somebody.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>Some more important than others…</b></h3>
<p>Laura: We’ve been dance partners for </p>
<p>Sol: Five years of more</p>
<p>Laura: five years. and we’ve been boyfriend and girlfriend for four years now.</p>
<p>Sol: We got lucky in that regards, because I know a lot of fellow dancers and a lot of teacher’s friends – we’re talking Bachata, Salsa, Kizomba – that since I’ve been teaching with Laura have changed three to four different dance partners. We’ve been lucky and blessed, in that we found it first time. I didn’t have to try with different people and different dance partners. The first time that we got into the business, we found each other.</p>
<p>Laura: In this Latin dance world, there is so much mess. In that you become dance partners, and you become boyfriend & girlfriend or you sleep together because there is that much connection when you’re dancing together and practicing together and living together. This happens! They either stay together, or t hey break up because its a very challenging thing to be in a relationship in this business. </p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>All it takes it the right drink, and the right song</b></h3>
<p>Sol: Some people quit altogether and go back to their main job. Some people try with somebody else. Its the same story that happens all the time, you have this dance partner and they get involved romantically and they break up.</p>
<p>Laura: And it goes round in a circle.</p>
<p>Sol: The thing is to me, it makes sense because of that passion that brought the man and the women together. They spend a lot of time together practicing, going over the moves getting close. When they get a booking, like we get right here at the Newcastle Salsa Congress they spend a lot of time in the hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Laura: There is alcohol involved! … the right song…</p>
<p>Sol: All it takes is the right drink and the right song! [laughs] That’s all it takes. I would never blame, that’s just nature and just the way it is.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>No-one said it would be easy</b></h3>
<p>Sol: I’ve been very blessed to be with this one innocent partner the past five years. We try to make it work everyday. Its not easy. You’ve got to have the right attitude all the time. Like today, before my workshop, I was very tired and we traveled all day to get to Newcastle.</p>
<p>Laura: We worked late last night as well.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>Getting Down to Business</b></h3>
<p>Sol: We worked late, we had a little bit of a nap and we had to get up and work on what we where going to teach in the next thirty minutes. As soon as you walk out the hotel room, you’ve got to put a smile on your face because at the end of the day it wouldn’t be fair. I do not want people who have paid the full passes to see us in the worst light, they deserve the best of us.</p>
<p>Laura: Sometimes as couples we argue, and we still have to put on a smile. We can’t really show our emotion, as we need to stay professional. Its not easy as I’m a very emotional person. But this is my job, this is my full time job.</p>
<p>Sol: I’m the opposite. My dog could have died this morning and no-one would be able to tell from my face! I can just switch and put whatever problem I have on the side to keep my eyes on the prize – which is teaching and keeping it professional. Because at the end of the day, this is our job. This is what we chose to pay our bills at the end of the day and we cannot let our personal issues get in the way of people enjoying the weekend.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>Invest in yourself, and support those around you</b></h3>
<p>Sol: Its important for people to invest in themselves and believe they can do it. And to believe they can achieve whatever image of their future selves they have. What happens is that there is going to be a lot of failures. A lot of failures. Even if your gaining bit by bit, through repetition, always think about where you want to be. </p>
<p>Laura: The competition is very very high.</p>
<p>Sol: You’ve just got to specialize in that one thing. A hole for them to make a name for themselves. For us it was hard-work, a lot of luck and plenty of support. And this is what I meant by investing in themselves.</p>
<p>When people see there own local people, or students trying – they are going to need support to make it. Nobody can achieve anything on their own, they are going to need support at some point. They just need that investment from people, people believing in them.</p>
<p>Something can happen, a gig or work can fall into their lap just by people talking about them. We struggled a lot the first two years we where in the business, it was very hard to pay the bills. But I never doubted that we could get to a point where we have food on the table, and bills are paid and stuff. It took us three years of hard work, and all the stuff that happens behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Laura: Hard work.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>Be different, be you.</b></h3>
<p>Sol: Behind the scenes is an ugly place to be and its something that they’re gonna need to figure out. But hard-work, talent and always stay humble. These are the three things that I would always tell anybody wanting to do this. Be different, be you. Don’t change for nobody else. Don’t be one person for one to two years, and then change drastically into somebody else. Just be you. Be the person you invested in and everything should be okay.</p></div>

		<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
The second couple I cornered at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/northernsalsa/">Newcastle Salsa Congress</a> where Bachata artists <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sol.hissirou">Sol</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/laura.fogliata.5?ref=br_rs">Laura</a>. The pair give off such a passionate vibe it was infectious.
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>
Clint: So, Salsa. Where did you start?</p>
<p>Sol: Me, personally? It was around 2009 – but I wasn’t taking it very seriously. My brother asked me to come once, twice and I learned a few moves from there. Its not until 2011 that I started taking classes and started really dancing socially.  [turns to Laura] When did you start?</p>
<p>Laura: Some years after you. You started first. There was a couple of years maybe after –</p>
<p>Sol: 2011, or 12 or something?</p>
<p>Laura: I used to go to an [Acrobatics] class for kids, actually, I was the only adult in there. Where I contour and did all this crazy stuff. After the Acro class was a Salsa lesson, and what afternoon the guy was like “why don’t you try it out?”. My first lesson was Tango, actually, and I started and I fell in love with it. That’s how I started my tango, then my Salsa.</p>
<p>Sol: There’s something actually very funny, because, obviously like in festivals and congresses. Like the one we are in right now. There are three main styles of dances. You’ve got Salsa, obviously. You’ve got Bachata and you’ve got Kizomba. The Salsa one is the one that everybody knows what Salsa is, even if you don’t know what it looks like, you’ve heard that there is a dance called salsa.</p>
<p>Laura: Salsa is very popular.</p>
<p>Sol: But what actually made me stay that long in the Latin dance scene was that I fell in love with Bachata. Salsa for me was a door  that introduced me to Bachata. Its when I started listening to Bachata, dancing with Bachata I completely fell in love with it. And I started teaching, that’s when I met [Laura].</p>
<p>Laura: He actually made me love in Bachata. I used to hate Bachata, I thought it was basic and boring. But he introduced me to it, and learn steps and stuff. He was such a passionate person.</p></blockquote>
<p>I common refrain I hear from dancers is how they found their preferred style though another, often Salsa. The community is large and welcoming, but the doors into it can seen very niche tucked out of site at times.</p>
<p>There is a very big temptation to join one of the many “tribes” in the community, and to look down at one style or another for whatever reason. Its important to remember that by taking a chance is how we became initiated into this vibrant scene.</p>
<p>Maybe some readers are wanting to knuckle down and get really serious, getting involved in performance groups or competitions. Maybe another style, not Latin at all. It could be something as simple as being shy about putting a styling workshop to work in a social setting, or even getting that person’s number.</p>
<p>Why not open the door an inch on something new, and have a look on what’s on the other side?</p>

<p><i>Last Friday I dragged Tina through the pouring rain to the Newcastle Salsa Congress seeking content for this blog. I managed to record nearly 2 hours of audio, which I will be writing up in the coming weeks!</i></p>
<p>Clint: So, you said you were in South Africa. You were 14, 16? Did you just end up in a club, or did you..?</p>
<p>David: Well my friends, my Angolan Friends, invited me to their house party. They’d been dancing kizomba. Just traditionally. They grew up listening to Portuguese music and were dancing it in a really natural way and that was when I first started learning it. They showed me the steps on how to do it, but it was very basic. It was a while ago, in the 90’s, early 2000’s. Then I came to the UK, here to Newcastle about 7 years ago and I started learning more traditional kizomba and steps with counts.</p>
<p>Clint: So, what brought you to the UK, was it the dancing? Or were you just working?</p>
<p>David: Working, yes. I came to the UK for work as a professional engineer.</p>
<p>Clint: Okay. Was the dancing just a hobby?</p>
<p>David: It was a hobby. I actually started learning in South Africa; partnered work, latin american, and ballroom dancing. I learnt salsa, and all that, about 9 years ago. I came to Newcastle and I started developing more… specifically… in salsa. Back then it was mainly salsa, mostly salsa. In those times there used to be a group that toured the country, and also internationally, called Latin Connection. I was part of the performance team for about 2 years. That’s when I really developed my salsa skills. I still had the kizomba skills, but it wasn’t as used as the salsa skills. Then in about 2013 I started doing partner work stuff with a partner of mine that I used to dance with in shows, demos, teaching and competitions. So, in 2013 we competed in the Teeside Salsa Festival Salsa Heats. My partner and I of that time, we won the heat and we went to London to Scala Latino. I don’t know if you know Scala Latino, it’s one of the old, old salsa clubs. So, we went there for the championship finals and we came runners’ up salsa champions. That’s a lot of my salsa history. So, with salsa I was traveling all over with Latin Connection, we were performing with a lot of salsa congresses around the UK and internationally; Scotland, Birmingham, London and a whole lot of places that are not coming to me now! [laughs]. So, after the competitions and the solo work – I then was actually in Newcastle, where I live, and I joined a new team that started to develop called The Mambo Factory.</p>
<p>Clint: I’ve heard of them, yea.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-w31uq2bOROI/WlfZDdb7piI/AAAAAAAAFbE/BCdUSQBayFAnlCXk1FGvTRLtvrBImyewQCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG_20180105_201000221.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="../../../contents/uploads/2018/01/IMG_20180105_201000221.jpg" width="320"></a></div>
<p>
David: I was actually one of the original members of The Mambo Factory. I performed with them for 3 years, until last year when we did our final Mambo Factory performance and the group went its separate ways. After The Mambo Factory died down, I started exploring my passion for kizomba. I am very passionate about salsa, but I am also very passionate about my upbringing with kizomba. I started exploring more advanced kizomba stuff – flashier, more modern kizomba stuff.</p>
<p>David: I was very used to the old stuff, but I wanted something newer, something fresher, something more exciting. Because the old traditional stuff is very calm and there’s a connection… it’s very relaxed. I wanted something more energetic as I was used to the energetic salsa, hard energetic salsa. So, I started exploring the new urban kiz concept. I travelled out of Britain and went to Dubai to do some lessons at the Dubai Kizomba Gold Congress. It was urban kiz training, so I did quite a few lessons there and started learning. Siobhan and I got together and we started practicing also, developing our urban kiz. Siobhan herself is a traditional kizomba dancer. I don’t know if she wants to say something?</p>
<p>Siobhan: Well, for me I believe I’m quite new, relatively compared to David. I’ve been dancing for two years. The first year doing some lessons at Black Swan with Chris. doing salsa, kizomba and bachata. I was enjoying it all, and went to Birmingham for the Latin Motion New Year party, in 2016, and I ended up in the kizomba room all night and absolutely loved it. So, for me, it was just – I felt more… of a connection with that dance, rather than with the other ones. So, I’ve been dancing just kizomba since then.</p>
<p>David: We started practising urban kiz, a lot. Starting with all the steps and working up to the advanced steps, and also practising the speed, and the timing to really start developing our connection and style. As well as increasing our repertoire of urban kiz moves so it flows easily. And that’s kind of where our passion for urban kiz started. </p>
<p>Siobhan: Yeah</p>
<p>David: So that’s when we started developing ourselves in urban kiz. It was invented five years ago in Paris. Quite a fresh new dance.</p>
<p>Clint: So how did you guys hear about urban kiz. Was it at the Dubai congress?</p>
<p>David: For me, it was before that. I met another guy, who I had done workshops before doing Dubai training. I had done some workshops with a guy, from France; Djemix, who was traveling the country teaching urban kiz. He learned the original urban kiz from France. He moved to the UK and started teaching all over the UK. That’s when I started learning – I learnt a few things from him, then I went and learned from the international artists there in Dubai. Yea…</p>
<p>Clint: So, you think there’s a big kizomba scene in the UK?</p>
<p>David: In UK? </p>
<p>Clint: It doesn’t seem as popular as salsa. Like, you go to a lot of clubs, there seems to be a lot of salsa.</p>
<p>Siobhan: Yea! </p>
<p>Clint: Maybe there’s a lot of bachata in some places, but kizomba – you maybe get a couple of tracks.</p>
<p>David: Kizomba… is not as popular as salsa, but there is still a big kizomba scene. It’s actually, mostly popular with the Angolan people, or the African people.</p>
<p>Tina: Yeah! [nods]</p>

<p>
Siobhan: So, we went to a party actually, in Newcastle. I think we saw you. It was when – I can’t remember what his name was – Mario something or other.</p>
<p>Clint: Mario Pertence!</p>
<p>Siobhan: And obviously from dancing kizomba at Black Swan, when not many people were dancing it at the time, to going there and seeing so many people dancing it and I was like “Where have all these people been?”.</p>
<p>David: When I moved to Newcastle seven years ago I remember it happening. But it’s been intermittent, so it’s never been constant. It goes from this venue, it goes again to another venue so… not as strong as salsa.</p>
<p>Clint: It always seems that salsa has fliers in bars, Facebook pages. But that kizomba night I had to phone a number to book tickets and sometimes meet someone in a bar.</p>
<p>David: Ahh!</p>
<p>Clint: It wasn’t as easy to go, you know.</p>
<p>Siobhan: I think that’s because salsa in Newcastle has been going a long time and it’s really established, the businesses are really established.</p>
<p>Clint: Oh, and kizomba is still finding its feet a bit?</p>
<p>Siobhan: Yeah, but, there is a regular night now. It’s still, relatively, new.</p>
<p>Clint: Where is that?</p>
<p>Siobhan: Rumba… on a Sunday with Mo?</p>
<p>Clint: Oh, I’ve heard of that… Coco’s night!</p>
<p>Siobhan: It is salsa and bachata.. as well, I think? I’ve not had the chance to go yet, but they seem to be focusing on doing kizomba at the moment, which is good! Hopefully there’ll be more kizomba dancers in the upcoming year.</p>
<p>David: Salsa in Newcastle, from what I recall and from what I’ve been told from most of the older salsa dancers. Is that over 12 to 14 years ago the original salsa in Newcastle was mostly Cuban style. I don’t know if you know Peter Robson?</p>
<p>Clint: I’ve seen Peter Robson, but I think Yersin is the main Cuban guy now.</p>
<p>Siobhan: Yea</p>
<p>David: Now it’s Yersin. Actually, when I finished performing with Latin Connection and after going solo with my partner, I was teaching for Yersin in SalsaAfro, we were called SalsaAfro dance troupe and it was during that time, this was 2014, that I was doing cuban salsa.</p>
<p>Siobhan: Was it still in Kommunity?</p>
<p>David: Yes, but it was called “Vamos”.</p>
<p>Clint: They were changing the sign and things when I first moved to Newcastle.</p>
<p>David: But before, actually before Vamos it was in… Space Bar in Newcastle College, and before that there were some regular Cuban classes in Gosforth, so it’s been all over.</p>
<p>Clint: So, compared to 14 years ago. How is the salsa, latin dancing scene now? Do you think it’s more popular, or its waned? How do you feel about it?</p>
<p>David: I think it’s more popular?</p>
<p>Clint: Yea?</p>
<p>David: Yeah.</p>
<p>Clint: I’ve only been involved for about a year and a half, so I don’t know the history, so this has been really interesting.</p>
<p>David: I think about 14 years ago…I don’t know if you know Coco Vega?</p>
<p>Clint: I think everyone knows Coco, there’s no salsa without Coco.</p>
<p>David: When Coco first came, and he was doing his big nights, he used to do some big student nights on a Wednesday. That was years ago, maybe 14-15 years ago. Latino nights.</p>
<p>Clint: I first saw him playing in Descarga? His band. Then I saw him in Harry’s, then in Bar Rumba, He’s been everywhere. Popping up.</p>
<p>David: Back in the days when it was still fresh, he used to run these big, big nights and all the students used to come to it. Really, really big. In the really established clubs like Madame Koo’s. But that all changed. It was years ago, when it was fresh… I think. But yea.</p>
<p>Clint: So, Coco has been going a while?</p>
<p>David: It’s been a while yea.</p>
<p>Clint: People always talk about Coco, and he’s still going.</p>
<p>David: He’s still going! What was your last question?</p>
<p>Clint: I can’t remember, but that was a good rabbit hole… </p>
<p>[I turned to Siobhan after messing about with my phone to start a new recording] <br>
So, what made you want to get into dancing? Black Swan was your first night?</p>
<p>Siobhan: Yeah so… for me, I had Always, Always wanted to dance. </p>
<p>Clint: Uh huh </p>
<p>Siobhan: But I had never had the opportunity to, so I was really self-conscious. I was really like, “I wish I could do this [dancing]”. I don’t drive, so I’m on public transport a lot and sitting on buses listening to songs, wishing I could be good at dancing. I had checked the salsa clubs a few times to check the times that the classes were on. But, it wasn’t until one of my friends from University had said we should go that I went along with her. She wasn’t that fussed, but I completely fell in love with it. And for the 1st year, every single Friday, every single Tuesday and like every event Chris was doing… I just got the guts to get up and do it. And I think it’s really nice for people who don’t have a dance background, and are nervous and self-conscious and don’t have the confidence to do a solo dance.</p>
<p>Clint: Yea </p>
<p>Siobhan: It’s so much less intimidating when you’re in hold with somebody and you’re in it together. So that’s what I love about dancing, especially kizomba as it’s so much about the connection you have with somebody and, like, learning how to follow and learning how to really naturally react to somebody’s movements. It’s really nice, and it sounds really soppy, but it’s actually really good for the soul – to just go dancing, put everything else aside, and have a really good time. If anyone was thinking about dancing, I would totally recommend it and support it.</p>
<p>David: For me also, dancing for me also is about the connection. Dancing is a language, in itself. It’s communication. It’s a special communication because there are no words spoken. It’s a feeling, and it’s kind of like a response with movement and body movement between your partner and that communication in itself is very special. So, that’s something that’s special for me. For me also, what is very special in dancing is I really feel the music and enjoy the music a lot. So, I like to portray that enjoyment of music in dancing – that also adds a really good dynamic when two people are enjoying the same music and dancing, and communicating with dancing. That’s something that I enjoy a lot. </p>
<p>Clint: I know it would be the same steps and things, but what for you is the difference between social dancing and a performance?</p>
<p>David: It’s very important to have a connection with your partner, and to not lose that connection, it’s extremely important. However, in performances, it’s very important to have a connection with the crowd because you’re performing to the crowd – so all your moves become flashier, and more open. So, your focal point changes between both your partner and the crowd – you have to try and connect with your partner and the crowd, and also express yourself in the dancing to the crowd. That is the biggest difference really. And then obviously, during performances, your moves are bigger, stronger, more dynamic. But when you’re dancing together it’s more careful, more controlled and your thinking how to lead in the most comfortable way possible. But when you’re doing a show it’s all about being flashy, dynamic, strong, expressive.</p>
<p>Clint: Interesting, that’s cool. Thank you that was great.</p>
