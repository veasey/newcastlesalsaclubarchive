There&#8217;s no dance without connection, and there&#8217;s no connection without passion. But how do you take your social dancing to the next level?<i> </i></p>
<p>These are some more highlighted excerpts from my interview with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sol.hissirou" target="_blank">Sol </a>&amp; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/laura.fogliata.5" target="_blank">Laura </a>from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/northernsalsa/" target="_blank">Newcastle Salsa Congress</a> which are thought where worth sharing. Even though they talk about Bachata, mostly, I believe the wisdom can be transferred not only to other styles of partnered dance but life in general!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>Never Stop Learning</b></h3>
<p>Sol: Bachata for us is limitless, as its our passion, its our specialism. Even as teachers, we still take workshops. We still take classes. We&#8217;re still learning and trying to better ourselves. I think that has a lot to do with the little bit of success we&#8217;ve had in the last five years. I think that&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve never stopped and thought &#8220;we&#8217;re teachers, we don&#8217;t need to take classes&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura: Never stop learning!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>Anybody Can Teach You Something</b></h3>
<p>Sol: I believe that anybody can teach me something. In life, or in dancing. Anybody who is anybody can teach me something. Even if its little, its that little thing that adds to the whole that I already have and makes me the person I want to be in the future.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>Its all about connections</b></h3>
<p>Sol: There&#8217;s a few Salsa songs I love, but Bachata makes me feel like&#8230;</p>
<p>Laura: Connected</p>
<p>Sol: Yes, Connected with the music and connected with the partner. And that could be anybody. Sometimes you can dance with somebody you have a strong connection with, and sometimes its someone I don&#8217;t have that strong connection with &#8211; but its still enjoyable and that is what I look for when I dance with somebody.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>Some more important than others&#8230;</b></h3>
<p>Laura: We&#8217;ve been dance partners for </p>
<p>Sol: Five years of more</p>
<p>Laura: five years. and we&#8217;ve been boyfriend and girlfriend for four years now.</p>
<p>Sol: We got lucky in that regards, because I know a lot of fellow dancers and a lot of teacher&#8217;s friends &#8211; we&#8217;re talking Bachata, Salsa, Kizomba &#8211; that since I&#8217;ve been teaching with Laura have changed three to four different dance partners. We&#8217;ve been lucky and blessed, in that we found it first time. I didn&#8217;t have to try with different people and different dance partners. The first time that we got into the business, we found each other.</p>
<p>Laura: In this Latin dance world, there is so much mess. In that you become dance partners, and you become boyfriend &amp; girlfriend or you sleep together because there is that much connection when you&#8217;re dancing together and practicing together and living together. This happens! They either stay together, or t hey break up because its a very challenging thing to be in a relationship in this business. </p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>All it takes it the right drink, and the right song</b></h3>
<p>Sol: Some people quit altogether and go back to their main job. Some people try with somebody else. Its the same story that happens all the time, you have this dance partner and they get involved romantically and they break up.</p>
<p>Laura: And it goes round in a circle.</p>
<p>Sol: The thing is to me, it makes sense because of that passion that brought the man and the women together. They spend a lot of time together practicing, going over the moves getting close. When they get a booking, like we get right here at the Newcastle Salsa Congress they spend a lot of time in the hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Laura: There is alcohol involved! &#8230; the right song&#8230;</p>
<p>Sol: All it takes is the right drink and the right song! [laughs] That&#8217;s all it takes. I would never blame, that&#8217;s just nature and just the way it is.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>No-one said it would be easy</b></h3>
<p>Sol: I&#8217;ve been very blessed to be with this one innocent partner the past five years. We try to make it work everyday. Its not easy. You&#8217;ve got to have the right attitude all the time. Like today, before my workshop, I was very tired and we traveled all day to get to Newcastle.</p>
<p>Laura: We worked late last night as well.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>Getting Down to Business</b></h3>
<p>Sol: We worked late, we had a little bit of a nap and we had to get up and work on what we where going to teach in the next thirty minutes. As soon as you walk out the hotel room, you&#8217;ve got to put a smile on your face because at the end of the day it wouldn&#8217;t be fair. I do not want people who have paid the full passes to see us in the worst light, they deserve the best of us.</p>
<p>Laura: Sometimes as couples we argue, and we still have to put on a smile. We can&#8217;t really show our emotion, as we need to stay professional. Its not easy as I&#8217;m a very emotional person. But this is my job, this is my full time job.</p>
<p>Sol: I&#8217;m the opposite. My dog could have died this morning and no-one would be able to tell from my face! I can just switch and put whatever problem I have on the side to keep my eyes on the prize &#8211; which is teaching and keeping it professional. Because at the end of the day, this is our job. This is what we chose to pay our bills at the end of the day and we cannot let our personal issues get in the way of people enjoying the weekend.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>Invest in yourself, and support those around you</b></h3>
<p>Sol: Its important for people to invest in themselves and believe they can do it. And to believe they can achieve whatever image of their future selves they have. What happens is that there is going to be a lot of failures. A lot of failures. Even if your gaining bit by bit, through repetition, always think about where you want to be. </p>
<p>Laura: The competition is very very high.</p>
<p>Sol: You&#8217;ve just got to specialize in that one thing. A hole for them to make a name for themselves. For us it was hard-work, a lot of luck and plenty of support. And this is what I meant by investing in themselves.</p>
<p>When people see there own local people, or students trying &#8211; they are going to need support to make it. Nobody can achieve anything on their own, they are going to need support at some point. They just need that investment from people, people believing in them.</p>
<p>Something can happen, a gig or work can fall into their lap just by people talking about them. We struggled a lot the first two years we where in the business, it was very hard to pay the bills. But I never doubted that we could get to a point where we have food on the table, and bills are paid and stuff. It took us three years of hard work, and all the stuff that happens behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Laura: Hard work.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
<b>Be different, be you.</b></h3>
<p>Sol: Behind the scenes is an ugly place to be and its something that they&#8217;re gonna need to figure out. But hard-work, talent and always stay humble. These are the three things that I would always tell anybody wanting to do this. Be different, be you. Don&#8217;t change for nobody else. Don&#8217;t be one person for one to two years, and then change drastically into somebody else. Just be you. Be the person you invested in and everything should be okay.</p></div>

The second couple I cornered at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/northernsalsa/">Newcastle Salsa Congress</a> where Bachata artists <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sol.hissirou">Sol</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/laura.fogliata.5?ref=br_rs">Laura</a>. The pair give off such a passionate vibe it was infectious.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>
Clint: So, Salsa. Where did you start?</p>
<p>Sol: Me, personally? It was around 2009 &#8211; but I wasn&#8217;t taking it very seriously. My brother asked me to come once, twice and I learned a few moves from there. Its not until 2011 that I started taking classes and started really dancing socially.&nbsp; [turns to Laura] When did you start?</p>
<p>Laura: Some years after you. You started first. There was a couple of years maybe after &#8211;</p>
<p>Sol: 2011, or 12 or something?</p>
<p>Laura: I used to go to an [Acrobatics] class for kids, actually, I was the only adult in there. Where I contour and did all this crazy stuff. After the Acro class was a Salsa lesson, and what afternoon the guy was like &#8220;why don&#8217;t you try it out?&#8221;. My first lesson was Tango, actually, and I started and I fell in love with it. That&#8217;s how I started my tango, then my Salsa.</p>
<p>Sol: There&#8217;s something actually very funny, because, obviously like in festivals and congresses. Like the one we are in right now. There are three main styles of dances. You&#8217;ve got Salsa, obviously. You&#8217;ve got Bachata and you&#8217;ve got Kizomba. The Salsa one is the one that everybody knows what Salsa is, even if you don&#8217;t know what it looks like, you&#8217;ve heard that there is a dance called salsa.</p>
<p>Laura: Salsa is very popular.</p>
<p>Sol: But what actually made me stay that long in the Latin dance scene was that I fell in love with Bachata. Salsa for me was a door&nbsp; that introduced me to Bachata. Its when I started listening to Bachata, dancing with Bachata I completely fell in love with it. And I started teaching, that&#8217;s when I met [Laura].</p>
<p>Laura: He actually made me love in Bachata. I used to hate Bachata, I thought it was basic and boring. But he introduced me to it, and learn steps and stuff. He was such a passionate person.</p></blockquote>
<p>I common refrain I hear from dancers is how they found their preferred style though another, often Salsa. The community is large and welcoming, but the doors into it can seen very niche tucked out of site at times.</p>
<p>There is a very big temptation to join one of the many &#8220;tribes&#8221; in the community, and to look down at one style or another for whatever reason. Its important to remember that by taking a chance is how we became initiated into this vibrant scene.</p>
<p>Maybe some readers are wanting to knuckle down and get really serious, getting involved in performance groups or competitions. Maybe another style, not Latin at all. It could be something as simple as being shy about putting a styling workshop to work in a social setting, or even getting that person&#8217;s number.</p>
<p>Why not open the door an inch on something new, and have a look on what&#8217;s on the other side?</p>
