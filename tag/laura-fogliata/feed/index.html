The second couple I cornered at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/northernsalsa/">Newcastle Salsa Congress</a> where Bachata artists <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sol.hissirou">Sol</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/laura.fogliata.5?ref=br_rs">Laura</a>. The pair give off such a passionate vibe it was infectious.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>
Clint: So, Salsa. Where did you start?</p>
<p>Sol: Me, personally? It was around 2009 &#8211; but I wasn&#8217;t taking it very seriously. My brother asked me to come once, twice and I learned a few moves from there. Its not until 2011 that I started taking classes and started really dancing socially.&nbsp; [turns to Laura] When did you start?</p>
<p>Laura: Some years after you. You started first. There was a couple of years maybe after &#8211;</p>
<p>Sol: 2011, or 12 or something?</p>
<p>Laura: I used to go to an [Acrobatics] class for kids, actually, I was the only adult in there. Where I contour and did all this crazy stuff. After the Acro class was a Salsa lesson, and what afternoon the guy was like &#8220;why don&#8217;t you try it out?&#8221;. My first lesson was Tango, actually, and I started and I fell in love with it. That&#8217;s how I started my tango, then my Salsa.</p>
<p>Sol: There&#8217;s something actually very funny, because, obviously like in festivals and congresses. Like the one we are in right now. There are three main styles of dances. You&#8217;ve got Salsa, obviously. You&#8217;ve got Bachata and you&#8217;ve got Kizomba. The Salsa one is the one that everybody knows what Salsa is, even if you don&#8217;t know what it looks like, you&#8217;ve heard that there is a dance called salsa.</p>
<p>Laura: Salsa is very popular.</p>
<p>Sol: But what actually made me stay that long in the Latin dance scene was that I fell in love with Bachata. Salsa for me was a door&nbsp; that introduced me to Bachata. Its when I started listening to Bachata, dancing with Bachata I completely fell in love with it. And I started teaching, that&#8217;s when I met [Laura].</p>
<p>Laura: He actually made me love in Bachata. I used to hate Bachata, I thought it was basic and boring. But he introduced me to it, and learn steps and stuff. He was such a passionate person.</p></blockquote>
<p>I common refrain I hear from dancers is how they found their preferred style though another, often Salsa. The community is large and welcoming, but the doors into it can seen very niche tucked out of site at times.</p>
<p>There is a very big temptation to join one of the many &#8220;tribes&#8221; in the community, and to look down at one style or another for whatever reason. Its important to remember that by taking a chance is how we became initiated into this vibrant scene.</p>
<p>Maybe some readers are wanting to knuckle down and get really serious, getting involved in performance groups or competitions. Maybe another style, not Latin at all. It could be something as simple as being shy about putting a styling workshop to work in a social setting, or even getting that person&#8217;s number.</p>
<p>Why not open the door an inch on something new, and have a look on what&#8217;s on the other side?</p>
