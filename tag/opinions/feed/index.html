What is the difference between a Salsa Social and a Salsa Party?</p></blockquote>
<p>Its a valid question, and one that I could not answer.</p>
<p>It began when I was trying to explain what the difference between a Latin Party and a &#8220;Social&#8221;. Most classes lead into an hour or two of social dancing, with a DJ.</p>
<p>There is no tangible difference, if you break it down using deductive logic.</p>
<p>Both events will have a DJ who plays Latin music, and it will probably take place in a venue where you have had classes.</p>
<p>I think the difference is an internal one.</p>
<p>What makes a &#8220;party&#8221;, is the decision to make it one.</p>
<p>It got me thinking though&#8230; </p>
<p>If a group of people can turn something routine into an exciting event just by choosing to &#8211; then how many other of life&#8217;s mundane events can be filled with the same zest and life as a party just because we chose to make it that way?</p>
<p>Obviously people dress differently, and let loose a little.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s the decision, and I believe the party has no difference for an observer externally (well, maybe the new shoes and outfits) but its the internal difference in the dancers themselves.</p>
<p>So why not take that same party attitude to your next class, or even to your workplace or next time you meet up with family?</p>
<p>I was going to play a cheeky remark here for comedy &#8211; about how I&#8217;d advise the reader not to form a conga line at work or shimmying in Tescos &#8211; but I actually believe life would be awesome.</p></div>
