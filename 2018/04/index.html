		<p>There’s a lot of resources on YouTube for dance. Hip-hop, as an example, has an abundance of videos. In the case of Salsa, there are less tutorials to pick from.</p>
<p>I believe this is to be expected as the techniques for dancing with a partner would be very hard to convey over a video.</p>
<p>Worse still, without an experienced instructor, any bad techniques learned that could injure a partner would go uncorrected.</p>
<p>Some resources, especially ones that explain musicality and the history behind Salsa I think are very valuable. Personally, I’d rather listen to a video or podcast in my own time.</p>
<p>I believe a majority of social dancers would be nonplussed if a Salsa class turned into a theory lecture.</p>
<p>A big part of Salsa, in my opinion, is the interaction between different dancers as well as its diverse and friendly social circle.</p>
<p>I appreciate the effort and time that has gone into these resources, and they probably provide a useful supplement for the addicted between events and help entice new beginners.</p>
<p>Overall though, learning Salsa by yourself, without other people? Doesn’t sound very fun at all.</p>

		<p>Does such a thing exist? Of course!</p>
<p>Here is my three step plan to shimmy responsibly:</p>
<h3>Situational Awareness</h3>
<p>Are you at a party? If so, this would be a recommended time to shimmy. If you’re not at a party, and are at a funeral or operating<br>
heavy machinery then this would be an inopportune time to shimmy.</p>
<p>Military personnel and assassins trying to retain an element of stealth should<br>
also refrain from unnecessary rhythmic movement of the shoulders. Unless you’re under deep cover at a salsa convention.</p>
<h3>Check Yourself</h3>
<p>Would likely injure yourself or others from spontaneous shoulder movement? If carrying a small child or getting an MRI this would be a bad time to shimmy.</p>
<h3>Eye Contact</h3>
<p>Whilst sweeping the immediate area before a shimmy, be careful not to engage in lingering eye contact with bouncers and members of law enforcement. Mostly because its weird.</p>
<p><em>This is the first part of a field manual I will be slowly compiling on the subject of shimmying responsibly. </em></p>
<p><em>By the year 2030 I will be planning a leather bound hardback edition and a download straight to your brain via your brain chip.</em></p>

		<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t make mistakes, just happy little accidents.” – Bob Ross</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sometimes you expect, or even need someone to do one thing and they end up doing the opposite.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At all levels of social dancing, it’s not uncommon for a lead to be misinterpreted or either dancer to miss a step.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complete disaster? Is the immaculate choreography ruined?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Perhaps not, unless you’ve dropped someone on their head. Did you happen to dance with Stone Cold Steve Austin?</p>
<figure id="attachment_203" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-203" style="width: 340px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-203" src="../../../contents/uploads/2018/04/Steve_Austin.png" alt="Steve Austin" width="340" height="476"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-203" class="wp-caption-text">The Bionic Redneck</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What really matters is how you handle that mistake. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your partner, onlookers and even your humble self will appreciate not making a scene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could even be the making of the routine, despite the perfectly sterile routines in our minds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But isn’t it our minds who control the body? So maybe part of us wants to make that mistake. If the mistake is intentional, is it still a mistake?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Herbie Hancock first played in Miles Davis’ string quartet he played a clanger, a wrong chord [clang!]. Miles paused, then played some improvised notes that made the chord right.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought I had just, like … we had built a house of cards and I just destroyed them all, you know?.. It took me years to realize Miles didn’t judge my chord, I did.” – Herbie Hancock</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dance equivalent to improving a melody to for the chord would be a follower styling out the rest of that bar of music instead of stopping or apologizing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think this is not only an important attitude to have on the dancefloor, but in life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calamity and resolution is a story. Everything going well is also a story, but one where nothing was learned and no room for growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All movement is technically a dance move. Next time you trip just claim you were breakdancing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forgotten everything, standing oddly still? That’s just contemporary! Make sure to snatch at the air a bit and pull it into your chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My backup is always to shimmy responsibly.</span></p>

		<p>It seems that every month I read another bio for a new dance couple that reads something like:</p>
<p>“We first started dancing [dance style] a year ago. We formed a connection instantly and picked up the style in record time. We now teach at [dance venue] every [week day]. To book tickets for [new couple] click here…”</p>
<p>On the one hand, I find these stories aspirational. It’s fantastic that within a year you can meet a fantastic dance partner, venue and paying students!</p>
<p>On the other, I see why people roll their eyes. How could you really learn anything within a year, good enough to teach?</p>
<p>What I really want to learn from these people is not the basics of [dance style] but how they managed to learn both the art of teaching and a new dance style within a year.</p>
<p>It’s the sort of scenario Tim Ferris would write about. He’d learn a dance style, raise the money to build a dance studio and promote it on a radio station he founded in Cuba.</p>
<p>Personally, as a random dude on the Internet, I believe people should be free to do what they want. As long as they’re humble and bringing in something fresh, maybe there is a lot to be learned from them.</p>
<p>I reserve a certain amount of cynicism, however. Teaching is hard. I’ve moonlighted in different disciplines, from time to time, and I’ve always felt it’s like herding cats.</p>
<p>But maybe with enough hard work, and sticking to one aspect of a style. Creating a slick, short class is achievable.</p>
<p>A lot of dancers may comment “well I’ve been dancing [number of years] and I wouldn’t feel comfortable teaching it”. There is a difference, however, of social dancing once a week and practicing every night for [amount of hours].</p>
<p>Maybe an amateur who commits to a goal, and strives for it every day is no longer an amateur? Maybe a professional is only a plastic professional until they’ve gained enough experience?</p>
<p>Either way I’d love to hear opinions from fresh faced greenhorns and old salts alike.</p>
<p>Always remember the following, however. It doesn’t matter whether you’re an excited new dance couple, established Salsa community lynch pin or just scouting for women at socials…</p>
<p>… always shimmy responsibly.</p>

		<blockquote><p>When we encounter another individual truly as a person, not as an object for use, we become fully human – Martin Buber</p></blockquote>
<p>When we refer to the connection between two dancers; leader and follower, it’s a reference to both a physical and mental one.</p>
<p>The physical connection refers to the hold and hand position. Through this, a leader can suggest the rhythm and positioning. He can also signal what moves are coming next and lead the follower through his improvised choreography.</p>
<p>A person might have an incredible command of the English language, say maybe a London barrister.</p>
<p>But would that person be able to form a meaningful connection with a stranger? The same barrister might struggle to hold your interest long enough to progress past painful small talk.</p>
<p>For something so intangible, the connection between two dancers is something that you can see the absence or presence of fairly quickly.</p>
<p>I believe one of the main draws and strengths of partnered dancing is not just the aesthetic beauty, but also the therapeutic quality of connecting with other members of your community.</p>
<p>Some members you may have never encountered or spoke to otherwise, some might not even speak the same language.</p>
<p>Maybe making a more concerted effort to form a deeper connection with other people in our lives would make us not only better dancers, but better people as well.</p>

		<h2>The Sorry</h2>
<p>Racked with guilt, this follower will usually start the dance by standing still looking you dead in the eyeballs before saying “sorry, I’m not very good”.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sorry!</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I often wonder what happened the last time they danced? I suspect it was in some kind of militant salsa boot-camp where they where berated daily by some kind of drill sergeant. </span></p>
<p>Or maybe they are here utterly against their will? Who knows. But what ever it is, they are sorry about it.</p>
<h2>The Dictator</h2>
<p>With the strength and courage gained via one to many cosmos this follower will embark on a one-person <i>coup d’état<b> </b></i>for control of the choreography.</p>
<p>She may proceed to bark commands:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, spin me!<br>
Catch Me!</p></blockquote>
<p>You smile, you ride it out. She says she came with her friend. You recognize her from your last dance.</p>
<p>Her friend shrugs meekly as she mouths:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sorry!</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Poker Player</h2>
<p>You ever danced with someone who looked like…</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-167" src="../../../contents/uploads/2018/03/Pokerface.jpg" alt="" width="285" height="178"></p>
<p>.. this?</p>
<p>I’m talking about this for the whole three minutes. You wonder if she’s bored, offended or maybe a robot sent from the future.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure I haven’t done anything wrong, but I feel sorry anyway.</p>
<h2>The Invisible Partner</h2>
<p>Always hilarious, always available and there to balance any offsets in the man/woman ration during classes.</p>
<p>I solid, dependable dancer who follows every move. She disregards any mistake, sloppy lead and even contorts to overcome any limitations imposed by physics or human anatomy.</p>
<p>She never talks back, and never expects a drink.</p>
<p>Main drawback however, is she’s not much of a talker. Plus she can draw some odd looks at socials. Especially when you try to introduce her.</p>
