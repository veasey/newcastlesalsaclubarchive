Not everyone has the luxury of being able to attend a Salsa social every night to hone their sweet routines and shines (well, unless you live in Newcastle of course in which case you can shimmy <a href="http://www.newcastlesalsa.club/p/blog-page.html">every night of the week</a>).
<p>Or sometimes the other half is doing their hair or swearing at an engine in the garage.</p>
<p>There is no I in TEAM but there is an I in ‘Partnered Dancing’. So there’s usually some element of solo work.</p>
<p>Before you throw in the towel – the one hanging from your back pocket – and slip into the onesie you can always make like an 80’s Pop Idol and dance by yourself.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>

Timing</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
Find The One </h3>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-brdgfUJ-0iw/WZx0iK1nKFI/AAAAAAAACkc/hOXMF9BJqgwa8Lct-Oyyvw-wyCcOwFoHQCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG_20170822_185142259_BURST000_COVER_TOP.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1230" data-original-width="1600" height="245" src="../../../../../contents/uploads/2017/08/IMG_20170822_185142259_BURST000_COVER_TOP.jpg" width="320"></a></div>
<p>
Hanging round the dance floor, waiting for the One, we’ve all been there. Your dance partner has been to the bar twice and you’re still trying to pick up the rhythm.</p>
<p>If only you’d spent those ad breaks during your Come Dine With Me binge to train your ear! Instead you where scrolling Instagram, and here you are attracting the attention of other salsa dancers who are debating whether or not you are in need of medical attention as you try to catch the beat.</p>
<p>There’s an abundance of material on the web (especially YouTube, just search “Salsa Timing” or something) detailing musicality and timing. </p>
<p>You can watch all the videos in the world, but it don’t mean squat unless you train yourself to find the beat. Obviously listening to the music for pleasure will help bucket loads in and of itself, but consciously trying to find the beat in your head will train your ear and mind and will help you so much on the dance floor.</p>
<p>You don’t even have to move off the sofa. You could do this now, you could literally do it now whilst you’re reading this fantastic article.</p>

Footwork</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
Footloose, but don’t kick of those Sunday Shoes! </h3>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qeIO_9kRic8/WZx4uKE7afI/AAAAAAAACkw/cHJwwvvZ0fE_46KcynGuffXz3txQiohJwCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG_20170822_185202692.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1443" data-original-width="1600" height="288" src="../../../../../contents/uploads/2017/08/IMG_20170822_185202692.jpg" width="320"></a></div>
<p>
If you didn’t guess from the punny header – continuing with the 80’s pop theme, the next section is going to encourage you to practice your footwork.</p>
<p>I’m bored of writing about people taking tiny steps, because now I think people are actively lunging in a shady silent protest. But now your tiny apartment, garage or living room can now aid your positioning and footwork.</p>
<p>A smaller space forces you to not only be creative in a smaller space, but is good practice.</p>
<p>Even partnered routines can be practiced alone, even if you just focus on your form and footwork. Not only can you commit these to muscle memory, freeing up your upper body, but it will also improve your balance.</p>
<p>I know your balance is “OK” now, but you’ll be thankful you’ve trained a little extra on it after your third Rum and Coke and your feet have got it licked even when your mind is still working out what song is on.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">
 Shimmy</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
Its a nice day for a …. Shimmy</h3>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2KaUitc6p2E/WZx6wJCxiLI/AAAAAAAACk8/8WN7baJW3CATXPfn-G2bye4Mobgy6FLswCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG_20170822_185637462.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1121" data-original-width="1600" height="224" src="../../../../../contents/uploads/2017/08/IMG_20170822_185637462.jpg" width="320"></a></div>
<p>
If you’ve been taking a couple years worth of Salsa Lessons and still can’t shimmey then this is for you.</p>
<p>Yes you. Johnny / Madame Gorilla Shoulders.</p>
<p>Unless you’re the Abominable Snowman you probably have some control of movement in your shoulders.</p>
<p>This is your time, you can finally practice the shimmey, body rolls and that fruity hand thing (where it looks like you’re holding a tiny egg) without mockey and judgment.</p>
<p>Unless your better half is trying to watch Come Dine With Me that is, and they’re all like “Sit Down”, “What are you doing?”, “I’m going in the other room, this is weird”.</p>
<p>Again, there’s loads of material on-line (outside this goldmine, obviously). I bet you’ve even covered some form of body isolation in a workshop. But never practiced it.</p>
<p>Well, here’s the time to do it!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">
I’m Starting With The Man In The Mirror!</h2>
<p>Well, I’m gonna wrap this article up with one final tortured lyrical reference.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the luxury of a large mirror,<br>
 you can always prop your phone up and set it to record. </p>
<p>You can<br>
dance like no-ones watching then curl up and revel in the cringe factor<br>
afterwards!</p></div>

<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>
What is the difference between a Salsa Social and a Salsa Party?</p></blockquote>
<p>Its a valid question, and one that I could not answer.</p>
<p>It began when I was trying to explain what the difference between a Latin Party and a “Social”. Most classes lead into an hour or two of social dancing, with a DJ.</p>
<p>There is no tangible difference, if you break it down using deductive logic.</p>
<p>Both events will have a DJ who plays Latin music, and it will probably take place in a venue where you have had classes.</p>
<p>I think the difference is an internal one.</p>
<p>What makes a “party”, is the decision to make it one.</p>
<p>It got me thinking though… </p>
<p>If a group of people can turn something routine into an exciting event just by choosing to – then how many other of life’s mundane events can be filled with the same zest and life as a party just because we chose to make it that way?</p>
<p>Obviously people dress differently, and let loose a little.</p>
<p>But that’s the decision, and I believe the party has no difference for an observer externally (well, maybe the new shoes and outfits) but its the internal difference in the dancers themselves.</p>
<p>So why not take that same party attitude to your next class, or even to your workplace or next time you meet up with family?</p>
<p>I was going to play a cheeky remark here for comedy – about how I’d advise the reader not to form a conga line at work or shimmying in Tescos – but I actually believe life would be awesome.</p></div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<h4 style="text-align: left;">
Its a bit of a culture shock. We can rule the seas, literally fight wars over tea and make the entire world set their watch by us. But when faced with dancing, smiling and making eye contact with the opposite sex – its enough to make our stiff upper lips quiver.</h4>
<div style="text-align: left;">
This is why I thought I’d address the elephant in the room, and address the problems Brits face at Salsa events.
<p>Despite the images of British club life portrayed on television, most clubs on a weekend consist of a huddle of grown men and women having a (gradually louder) conversation over a pint glass. </p>
<p>Around half eleven, a band of women might break form and start dancing around their hand bags to the latest Chain Smokers record.</p></div>
<p>
The guys will watch the ladies, often in silence, before queuing for a kebab on the way home.</p>

</div>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">
We’re All Closet Disco Dancers</h2>
<p>Although most notable Salsa Play-lists consist of songs off a 4/4 timing, the kick is not as pronounced or important. Most club music we are used to, we follow a heavy ‘4 to the floor’ beat, the same rhythm we’ve grown accustomed to from the late 70’s disco era.</p>
<p>It takes time for Brit to acclimatise to the new rhythms. A big part of dancing is actually training the brain as well as the body. A lot of Cuban music, even their chart music, has jazz roots and will include more playful rhythms and even a change in tempo.</p>
<p>This is a far cry to to what we usually nod along to in wetherspoons, so it takes time to get used to it.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">
Our Main Aim is to get Wasted</h2>
<p>Europeans will generally enjoy a glass or two of wine with a meal. For a Brit, a couple of bottles is “warming up” before we leave the house.</p>
<p>This extends our first point, that complicated and subtle music does not have a place for a tanked up Brit who is having enough problem trying to feign sobriety to slip past the bouncers and still get served.</p>
<p>Staying perched on a bar stool is enough trouble, and now you expect us to perform subtle footwork and tight turns? </p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">
“Just Who Does He Think He Is?”</h2>
<p>Showing off is generally frowned upon. If you see a man walk in with expensive jewelry on show, bright colors or – god forbid – a <b>hat </b>then we’ll all exchange a sideways glance at one another and wait for them to be out of ear shot so we can slag them off (because we wouldn’t want to offend them, you see).</p>
<p>We’re actually secretly grateful, and in desperate need, for such characters to grace us with their presence as its gives us something to talk about other than the weather.</p>
<p>We’re naturally very uncomfortable in our own skin and I think when you see someone who it highlights our own insecurities.</p>
<p>So I’ve just written four paragraphs on why a hat would cause a ruckus, so imagine the splash some bloke is going to have if he starts spinning around the dance floor.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">
There’s No Licensing Involved for this Higher Art Form</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;">
When we think of dancing in the UK, we think of ballet dancers or urban youths spinning on their heads. Dancing is something technical that requires careful study and flamboyant attire.
<p>Africans dance for literally any or no reason.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>
Ayyyyyyy!! – An African within 10 meters of a radio.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"></blockquote>
<p>Whether its finding a toy in a cereal box, tax-rebate or someone turned on the radio its a natural part of life.</p>
<p>I think we like order and structure. We need some form of signal, or license, or piece of paperwork from the council that would tell us what kind of dance is appropriate and at what time that dance should start and when it can end.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">
It Affects Our Ability To Re-Enter the UK and Our Marriages</h2>
<p>Like some kind of extra chromosome that only exists abroad, or in our flamboyant mates, unless you’re dry humping the shot girl’s leg at 1am then both your nationality and sexuality will be brought into question.</p>
<p>You can get away with it though if all your mates have had at least eleven pints, then by the morning they wouldn’t have remembered any of it.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">
I’m Wrap This Post Up With Another Sauce Pun</h2>
<p>I hope you had as much fun reading this as I did writing it. Of course, the most popular British past time not mentioned is roasting ourselves.</p>
<p>So much like the dip, you shouldn’t be afraid of the heat but revel in it. If not, then I’ll meet you in ‘spoons for a pint and a debate about whose football team is better and why you’re wrong.</p>
<p>
Peace!</p></div>

		<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
Having too much fun? Meeting too many new people? Or maybe your just too polite to excuse yourself from getting dragged along with your friends.</div>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Fear not, for I’ve compiled a list of the worst advice which will enable you to make a splash and make sure you are remembered!</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
<p> </p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Smell Awful</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;">Going out for food beforehand? Make sure to pick an option with garlic. Bonus points for coming straight from the gym, or keeping the same clothes on after a long day at work.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Its better to arrive 20 minutes late and smell like a flowery meadow, than to engage in aromatic warfare with your partner.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">

</div>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Arrive Drunk</h2>
<p>Remember that drinking is a competition, so don’t get left behind! You can get a head start on the competition – and avoid those expensive restaurant prices – by getting tanked up beforehand.</p>
<p>Drunk is loud and loud is fun. Your charisma and coordination only improve with every additional unit of alcohol. So bottoms up!</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/1f/9c/a1/1f9ca12385cfac743e55473d9de2f6c9.jpg" alt="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/1f/9c/a1/1f9ca12385cfac743e55473d9de2f6c9.jpg"></div>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Wear Offensive Footwear</h2>
<p>I have genuinely seen men in motorcycle boots. These offer fantastic protection for your feet. In particular it will shield your delicate heels from the abrasive and hard toes of other dancers.</p>
<p>Ladies, heels that are as tall and narrow as possible. If you do topple, you can regain your balance by spearing another dancer through the calf muscle. Not only will this add unique styling, but will prevent anyone from outshining you.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TgvAYBCb1M8/WVICgxuj-XI/AAAAAAAACX0/eDUqW--FE-sdeOvy6JB76Kj_QdgwaA-jgCLcBGAs/s1600/no%2Bidea.jpg"><img src="../../../../../contents/uploads/2017/06/noidea.jpg" width="200" height="131" border="0" data-original-height="414" data-original-width="625"></a></div>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Don’t Learn Steps</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;">Why spend your hard earned cash on classes, when you can badger other people for free? If no-one is offering a free tutorial, simply grab someone at random and pull their arms as hard as you can.You’ve seen people do this in the movies, how hard can it be?
<p>Maybe you dance Jive and find yourself at a Salsa night, or only know cross-body but want to try a Kizomba night?</p>
<p>Just power through every track with the steps you know, everyone else is wrong. While you’re at it, you might as well bust out the Macarena during the cha-cha track.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"> <img class="irc_mi" style="margin-top: 0px;" src="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/000/472/seriouscatcover.jpg" alt="Image result for serious" width="200" height="200"></div>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Be Really Really Serious</h2>
<p>Your face should show that your here to win. Your not a child in need of friends. Second place, is first loser.</p>
<p>Assert your dominance over your partner by staring through them. Tut if they make a mistake. Steer them through each move, and repeat moves they got wrong until you have fixed them.</p>
<p>If the serial killer death stare is not your style, then could always be the cool edgy one who refuses to talk, smile or even look at your partner. A free hand can be utilized to check your phone.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/22/9f/90/229f904d90b96597d619919992e05a8d.jpg" alt="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/22/9f/90/229f904d90b96597d619919992e05a8d.jpg"></div>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">[Bonus] Remember That Everyone is Judging you all the time</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;">Everyone is judging you from the moment you walk through the door, till the moment you leave.We actually was already watching on our network of spy cameras and laugh at every mis-step and botched move.
<p>We not only laugh, but we write them down in a register. If you look like your having too much fun, we’ll report you to the Salsa police who will Shimmy their way through your living room one day and take you to Salsa prison – where your only sustenance will be the fruit you can eat out of the cocktails, dance everywhere and have to spend the remainder of your years wearing sequins.</p>
